                Hi everyone! In this tutorial I'm going to explain what Metadata is, and how we can extract very useful and dangerous informations from any image file.
            </p>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3>How is this possible and what data can we find?</h3>
                <p>
                    Everytime we take a picture, some set of data is also binded to that image, which enables that file to be understood by other software and human users. Metdata (that’s how the data stored in an image is called) can be found internally (embedded in the image file) or externally (in digital assent management systems for example). 
                    But what data is exactly stored inside an image? <br>
                    Inside the file you could find copyright information, camera details or settings and so on. As most of the data is generated by the device you are taking the photo with, we could also find some malicious and potentially dangerous data, like the GPS position, phone brand, software, date and time when the image was taken or even intentional data that someone could put in that image (and it’s easier than it seems).
                </p>
                <h3>How to extract this data from an image?</h3>
                <p>
                    I am going to analyze 3 ways you could do this: form a Linux (also MacOS or Windows, but this tutorial is focused on Linux) terminal, from a website and from a browser extension.
                </p>
                <h3>The terminal way</h3>
                <p>
                    For this tutorial I am going to use Kali Linux, which already has the tools I need installed, but if you are following along from another Linux distro, or from another operating system, the program I am using is “exiftool”, and in order to install it (Linux) just type 
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    apt install exiftool
                </div>
                <p>
                    Now let’s use it. To make sure to run the terminal in the folder where the image you want to extract the data from is in, so you don’t have to type all the picture path in the command, then we can simply proceed with typing 
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    exiftool “imagename”
                </div>
                <p>
                    The output you are going to see will be similar to this 
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="data.png" class="FinalImage">
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    As you can see there are some very dangerous information, like the GPS position (which is perfectly accurate)<br>
                    So should you be afraid of posting this on social media? Well nowadays usually social media strip this data out when someone posts a picture. However this will not happen when sending emails, or with other ways of communication, so be careful.
                </p>
                <h3>The website way</h3>
                <p>
                    If you cant’s be bothered opening a terminal, there is another way this process can be done, and it is using various websites. For this tutorial the website I’m going to use is verexif.com, where you can simply upload an image from your directory, and have an output of the metadata. In alternative to uploading a downloaded file you can also submit an URL. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <img class="FinalImage" src="website.PNG">
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    The website also gives you the opportunity of removing that data from your file if you like to. And in case it finds a GPS position, it will also show you that directly on a map.
                </p>
                <h3>The web extension way</h3>
                <p>
                    Another simple way is to add a browser extension. There are many, and it depends on the browser you are using. In this case I am using Chrome, with the “EXIF Viewer Classic”, that will show me the metadata of whatever image a hover on. If you don’t want to use this extension, or don’t want to use Chrome (understandable) just search for “exif” in your extension store, and you will find many alternatives.
