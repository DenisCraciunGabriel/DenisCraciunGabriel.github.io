            <p>Have you ever found yourself in an Hotel, Airplane, Coffee Shop, and suddenly you see an apparently open Wi-Fi. But when you actually try and connect to it, you will be redirected to an authentication page where you will be asked to login. With MAC spoofing it actually is possible to avoid this. Keep in mind that as in every cybersecurity tutorial, I am using Linux. MAC spoofing is possible for every operating spoofing, but if you want to follow along, then make sure to be on Linux.
            </p>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3>But what is a MAC address?</h3>
                <img src="network.png" class="ArticleImage">
                <p>
                    MAC stands for Media Access Control address, and it is a unique identifier that every network interface controller (NIC) of any device has assigned for connecting to a network address. MAC addresses are made by six groups of two hexadecimal digits, and it is assigned by the device manufacture.
                </p>
            </div>
                <h3>How are we going to proceed?</h3>
                <img src="hacker.jpg" class="ArticleImage">
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    We are going to do something called MAC spoofing, which basically allows your device to pretend being another one by faking another MAC address of another device (as MAC addresses are unique for every device in the world). The reason why this works with Wi-Fis such as the ones in a Coffee Shop, is because they keep track of who is allowed and who’s not thanks to a whitelist. Once someone is authorized, it gets into the whitelist where it is identified via its MAC address.<br>
                    What we need to do then is scan the area and find a device that is already authorized, spoof its address and pretend to be it.
                </p>
                <div class="Disclaimer">
                    <h2>Disclaimer: </h2>
                    <p>
                        Keep in mind that in order to do this we need a network card that can be put into wireless monitor mode. Some new laptops already have a decent enough card that can get into monitor mode, but as you most likely won’t have one, I’ll leave you the link of the one I use *here*, so you can have an idea of what that is, and eventually either purchase that one or another.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3>Make sure to have all the tools required</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are using Kali you will most likely have all of them already preinstalled (macchanger, aircrack-ng), but for those of you who are not using it, I’ll go through the process in order to simply install them. First open your terminal and type
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    apt-get install macchanger aircrack-ng
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3>Randomize our MAC address</h3>
                <p>
                    Just to be more secure, we want to randomize our current MAC address as we are connecting to a public network. In order to do that open the terminal and type
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    sudo ip a
                </div>
                <p>
                    you will now see a list of all your network cards. Now just identify the name of the network card you are using (if you don’t know it, it most likely is “wlan0”). After doing that, we need to disable our network card, and then just randomize it by typing. In order to disable the card we type in the terminal
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
                </div>
                <p>
                    In this line I considered “wlan0” being your network card, but just switch it with whatever your card’s name is. Now we can randomize the address with
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    sudo macchanger -r wlan0
                </div>
                <p>
                    after doing so make sure you have your network card up with
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3>Let's begin</h3>
                <p>
                    First thing to do is to put your network card into monitor mode. If you don’t know how to that don’t worry, as it is a simple process:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
                </div>
                <p>
                    In the previews line I assumed that your network’s card name is “wlan0”. After putting it in monitor mode, the name would become “wlan0mon”.
                </p>
                <h3>Find an authenticated device</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that the card is in monitor mode, we can start searching for other devices with
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
                </div>
                <p>
                    What you will see will be something like this: 
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="monitor.png" class="FinalImage">
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    What you are looking at is a list of all the operating networks. Once identified the network you can press Ctrl+C in order to stop refreshing (don’t worry, the list won’t disappear). The information you need to get from the network is the channel it is running in 
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="monitor2.png" class="FinalImage">
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    Once that’s identified we can proceed with
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    Sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon -c 11 - -encrypt OPM
                </div>
                <p>
                    -c stands for channel, and the number after it is the channel number. OPM tells the program we only want to see open networks. Now we will have a list with all the devices that are connected, or waiting for a connection, on that network. The ones connected are our victims for MAC spoofing. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="list.PNG" class="FinalImage">
            <div class="Disclaimer">
                <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>
                    Be careful with this as it could cause an IP collision, which consists in the router trying to give connection to us, and the victim at the same time. This might cause a DOS attack (Denial Of Service) and you can get in trouble for this
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3>Final step: gain access</h3>
                <p>
                    First of all make sure to have the victim’s MAC address either copied or written somewhere. <br>
                    After doing that we need to take our network card down again
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
            </div>
            <p>
                Now let’s change the MAC address with
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                sudo macchanger -m EE:3C:4C:D3:GA:35 wlan0
            </div>
            <p>
                The hexadecimal sequence you see in the line above is victim’s MAC. Now we can bring the card up again
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
            </div>
            <p>
                We now successfully gained access to the network!
            </p>
