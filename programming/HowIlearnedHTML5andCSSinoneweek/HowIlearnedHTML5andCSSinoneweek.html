                <p>Hi everyone! I hear lots of people being so scared about web development, as at first (especially for those that don't have experience with programming or web development) having to learn HTML5, CSS and JavaScript (at least) in order to create your own website might sound really complicated. I am here to explain how I managed to learn 2 out of these 3 languages in only one week. <br>
                The process is really not that hard, and I will break it down in steps so you can visualize it better:

                <h3>1. Learn the basics by yourself, on the internet</h3>
                <hr>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <img src="https://4cawmi2va33i3w6dek1d7y1m-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/7_2_HTML-and-CSS-Basics.png">
                    <p>
                    When I have to learn any programming language, I personally first start by watching a YouTube course that can give me a general idea of how that language works, especially the basics. I love watching FreeCodeCamp’s videos, and those are the ones that until now helped me the most. If you don’t find yourself watching online courses and want to go faster, you can also check out different websites that group all the basics in one place, such as W3Schools, which I find to be the best.

                <h3>2. Watch and understand other people’s projects</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    After learning the basics of a language you most likely won’t be able to start your own project yet, so what I do is watch videos (yes, YouTube is really underrated) of other people’s projects. That lets me understand and learn the most useful things apart from the basics, while also teaching me some tricks and throwing me into the next step, which is
                </p>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <h3>3. Start your own project, and learn while doing it</h3>
                <hr>
                <div class="paragraph">
                        <img src="https://www.rubyshore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rocket-launch.jpg">
                    <p>
                        Once you’ve watched other people’s projects, and take inspiration while also learning a bit, it’s time to take the most important step: build your own project. Obviously you probably won’t be able to complete it without help, but the purpose of this is learning. My very first web development project was this website, and it was by trying to create it, checking StackOverlow for solutions, deleting and coding the pages over and over again, that I arrived here. At the moment the website is still not perfect, but by making it I can encourage anyone to get into web development, as it really isn’t as complicated as it looks.
